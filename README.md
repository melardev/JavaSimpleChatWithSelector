# Introduction
Very simple Java Console Chat application using Asynchronous sockets
with Selectors. This is here only because I had it since years ago,
but I would not recommend to use Selectors for Socket programming.
I recommend using CompletionHandlers instead, and the implementation given
in this project is not very solid, because it can not predict the message
before hand, and does not reuse the ByteBuffer object.
For a good implementation look my XeytajAsync application or JavaNetworkSnippets in my Github.
